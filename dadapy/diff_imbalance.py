class DiffImbalance:
    """Carries out the optimization of the DII(A(w)->B) with respect to the weights in the first distance space.

    The class 'DiffImbalance' supports two schemes for setting the smoothing parameter lambda, which tunes the
    size of neighborhoods in space A. In both schemes lambda can be epoch-dependent, i.e. decreased during the
    training according to a cosine decay between 'init' and 'final' values. The schemes are:

        1. Adaptive: lambda is equal for all the points and is set to a fraction (given by lambda_factor,
        default is 1/10) of the *average* square distance of k-th neighbors.

        Example:
            point_adapt_lambda: False
            k_init: 10
            k_final: 1
            lambda_factor=1/10

        2. Point-adaptive: lambda is different for each point. For point i, it is set to a fraction of the
        square distance between i and its k-th neighbor.

        Example:
            point_adapt_lambda: True
            k_init: 10
            k_final: 1
            lambda_factor=1/10

    As a rule of thumb, we suggest to set k_init and k_final to ~5% of the points in the data set, if mini-
    batches are not employed, or to ~5% of the points within each mini-batch, if they are employed.

    Attributes:
        data_A (np.array(float), jnp.array(float)): feature space A, matrix of shape (n_points, n_features_A).
        data_B (np.array(float), jnp.array(float)): feature space B, matrix of shape (n_points, n_features_B).
        periods_A (np.array(float), jnp.array(float)): array of shape (n_features_A,), periods of features A.
            Default is None, which means that features A are treated as nonperiodic. If not all features are
            periodic, the entries of the nonperiodic ones should be set to 0.
        periods_B (np.array(float), jnp.array(float)): array of shape (n_features_B,), periods of features B.
            Default is None, which means that features B are treated as nonperiodic. If not all features are
            periodic, the entries of the nonperiodic ones should be set to 0.
        num_epochs (int): number of training epochs. Default is 200.
        batches_per_epoch (int): number of minibatches; must be a divisor of n_points. Each weight update is
            carried out by computing the DII gradient over n_points / batches_per_epoch points. Default is 1,
            which means that the gradient is computed over all the available points (batch GD).
        seed (int): seed of JAX random generator, default is 0. Different seeds determine different mini-batch
            partitions.
        l1_strength (float): strength of the L1 regularization (LASSO) term. Default is 0.
        point_adapt_lambda (bool): whether to use a global smoothing parameter lambda for the c_ij coefficients
            in the DII (if False), or a different parameter for each point (if True). Default is True.
        k_init (int): initial rank of neighbors used to set lambda. Ranks are defined starting from 1. If
            batches_per_epoch > 1, neighbors are recomputed within each mini-batch. Default is 1.
        k_final (int): final rank of neighbors used to set lambda. If batches_per_epoch > 1, neighbors are
            recomputed within each mini-batch. Default is 1.
        lambda_factor (float): factor defining the scale of lambda. Default is 0.1.
        params_init (np.array(float), jnp.array(float)): array of shape (n_features_A,) containing the initial
            values of the scaling weights to be optimized. If None, params_init is set to [0.1, 0.1, ..., 0.1].
        optimizer_name (str): name of the optimizer, calling the Optax library. Possible choices are 'sgd'
            (default), 'adam' and 'adamw'. See https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/optimizers.html for
            additional details.
        learning_rate (float): value of the learning rate. Default is 1e-2.
        learning_rate_decay (str): schedule to damp the learning rate to zero starting from the value provided
            with the attribute learning_rate. The available schedules are: cosine decay ("cos"), exponential
            decay ("exp"; the initial learning rate is halved every 10 steps), or constant learning rate (None).
            Default is None (constant learning rate).
        num_points_rows (int): number of points sampled from the rows of rank and distance matrices. In case of large
            datasets, choosing num_points_rows < n_points can significantly speed up the training. The default is
            None, for which num_points_rows == n_points.

                of points along rows (nrows) and along columns (ncolumns) of distance and rank matrices, in two groups

                along axis=0 of data_A and data_B) that are known to be significantly correlated with i. For example,
                this may occur when the data set is a time series, and axis=0 is the time dimension. If compute_error
                is True, "time-correlated" points are excluded by subsampling the data along axis=0 with stride

                time window [i-discard_close_ind, i+discard_close_ind] are discarded. Default is 0, for which no
